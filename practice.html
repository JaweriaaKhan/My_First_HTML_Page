        As everyone do some mistakes bbecause no one is perfect, if you are thinking that you are perfect so you are becoming only proudy and thi is not good for you<br>
        But yes self confedence is the another thing , it is really important for anyone to have confedence on their self but it is really important also to make difference between self confedence and proudness.
